sitting
in
on
a
discussion
day
for
breast
cancer
campaign
yesterday,
i
was
astonished
at
how
much
detailed
work
goes
into
all
aspects
of
a
research
charity.
the
communications
department
was
kind
enough
to
ask
me
to
speak
at
its
event
and,
in
talking
to
some
of
the
team,
i
imbibed
the
enormous
enthusiasm
and
staggering
up-to-the-minute
knowledge
they
all
have
about
their
subject.the
breast
cancer
tissue
bank
grows
apace,
with
virtually
every
person
pleased
to
know
that
their
removed
tumour
and
tissue
are
being
put
to
such
good
use.
the
reputation
of
the
tissue
bank
has
spread
far
and
wide
and
i
have
even
been
the
recipient
of
a
request
to
use
it
from
a
new
york
breast
cancer
research
laboratory.
we
have
breast
cancer
campaign
with
the
financial
help
of
walk
the
walk
to
thank
for
this
amazing
storehouse
of
samples.indeed,
i
know
i
repeat
myself
but
where
on
earth
would
we
be
without
the
various
charities
who
fund
research
or
care
who
else
would
pick
up
the
pieces
after
a
diagnosis
of
cancer
who
else
would
provide
the
funds
for
essential,
life-saving
research
who
else
would
campaign
for
changes
in
the
law;
for
preventive
work;
for
education
about
the
various
cancersas
the
next
year
unfolds,
the
way
cancer
is
treated
will
continue
to
change.
personalised
medicine
will
target
tumours
more
accurately
and
fewer
patients
will
undergo
unnecessary
treatment.the
beginning
of
tumour
profiling
will
emerge
more
of
this
next
year
when
i
understand
it
properly
and
drugs
commonly
used
for
one
type
of
cancer
will
be
suggested
for
another.
examining
tumours
at
a
molecular
level
will
allow
for
analyses
of
the
cancer's
genetic
information
and
proteins
indeed,
the
word
cancer
may,
eventually,
not
even
have
a
body
part
attached
to
the
word.
the
disease
will
simply
be
called
cancer
and
each
case
will
be
treated
individually.the
caring
charities
will
continue
to
do
just
that
care
with
an
increasing
understanding
of
the
emotional
impact
that
a
diagnosis
of
cancer
has
on
the
patient,
the
family,
the
friends
and
the
work
colleagues.
helplines
will
expand
so
that
there
is
always
someone
who
understands
just
what
a
sudden
cancer
diagnosis
means
and
support
can
begin.charities
like
the
breast
cancer
haven
will
set
up
more
centres
and
offer
more
of
its
invaluable
complementary
therapies
to
those
who
can
walk
through
their
doors.
the
haven's
specialist
breast
cancer
nurses
will
continue
to
support
patients
before,
during
and
after
treatment.
i
hope
more
gps
will
learn
to
appreciate
the
untold
importance
of
the
haven's
work
and
not
so
readily
discard
fliers
brought
into
their
surgeries
for
display
purposes
perhaps
they
will
even
refer
their
patients
to
the
haven
or,
at
least,
give
them
the
website
address.for
male
cancers,
i
hope
that
more
men
like
roger
uttley
who
played
rugby
for
england
will
get
on
their
bikes
and
cycle
to
raise
money
and
awareness
for
prostate
cancer
uk.
roger's
ride
was
in
memory
of
his
friend,
andy
ripley
also
an
england
rugby
player
who
died
of
prostate
cancer
three
years
ago.
andy's
cancer
was
found
by
accident
after
being
taken
ill
with
an
embolism.as
roger
said,
in
an
interview
with
alex
lowe
of
the
times,
i
think
there
is
a
general
unwillingness
in
men
to
accept
there
might
be
something
wrong,
or
a
feeling
that
'i
will
address
this
later.'i
receive
many
emails
from
men
asking
why
breast
cancer
has
so
much
publicity.
my
answer
is
always
that
women
got
up
and
made
it
happen.
men
can
do
just
the
same
and
i
hope
that,
with
people
like
roger
uttley,
neil
stuke
and
ray
winstone
keeping
the
subject
in
front
of
the
public
we
may
see
a
sea-change
in
the
next
generation's
attitude
to
talking
about
the
embarrassing
cancers
and
seeking
help.thank
you
all
for
your
comments,
emails
and
support.
i
am
taking
a
couple
of
weeks'
break
over
the
festive
season
and
will
be
back
in
january.merry
christmas.http:www.thehaven.org.ukhttp:prostatecancer.org.ukhttp:www.orchid-cancer.org.ukhttp:www.breastcancercampaign.org
plans
by
the
bank
of
england
to
cap
riskier
mortgage
lending
are
being
seen
as
an
important
part
of
the
battle
against
the
chance
of
a
return
to
the
problem
mortgage
market
of
the
last
decade.under
the
proposals,
lenders
will
not
be
allowed
to
lend
any
more
than
15
per
cent
of
their
residential
mortgages
at
more
than
4.5
times
a
borrower's
income.if
the
government
really
believes
that
there
is
an
impending
housing
bubble
then
putting
a
cap
on
high-value
loans
is
long
overdue.experience
tells
us
that
even
a
small
slump
in
property
prices
can
leave
people
in
negative
equity
and
anyone
who
has
stretched
their
finances
to
the
limit
to
borrow
is
at
risk.the
announcement
made
yesterday
was
a
major
departure
for
the
uk.
as
andrew
tyrie,
chairman
of
the
treasury
select
committee,
said:
the
measure
is
an
important
signal.
it
demonstrates
the
bank's
preparedness
to
use
a
financial
stability
tool
as
an
insurance
against
the
risk
of
overheating.
it
is
a
major
departure
for
the
uk.but
the
question
is,
has
the
bank
gone
far
enough
mr
carney
has
alighted
on
4.5
times
salary
as
his
limit
to,
as
he
puts
it,
set
a
fire-break
on
riskier
lending.but
some
lenders,
such
as
lloyds
and
rbs,
have
already
set
their
limit
lower,
at
four
times
income,
albeit
only
for
loans
worth
more
than
Â£500,000.as
we
discovered
in
the
crazy
days
of
the
last
decade
when
banks
lent
almost
to
anyone
with
a
pulse,
we
need
sensible
limits
on
lending.maybe
the
governor
should
have
listened
to
the
banks
and,
as
well
as
limiting
to
15
per
cent
the
number
of
loans
at
high
multiples
of
income,
he
should
have
cracked
down
on
how
high
those
multiples
should
be
with
higher-value
loans.it
says
something
when
our
high
street
banks
are
being
more
prudent
than
our
financial
guardians.
